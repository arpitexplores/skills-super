# Content Quality & E-E-A-T Analysis

## E-E-A-T Framework (updated Sept 2025 QRG)

Read `skills/seo/references/eeat-framework.md` for full criteria.

### Experience (first-hand signals)
- Original research, case studies, before/after results
- Personal anecdotes, process documentation
- Unique data, proprietary insights
- Photos/videos from direct experience

### Expertise
- Author credentials, certifications, bio
- Professional background relevant to topic
- Technical depth appropriate for audience
- Accurate, well-sourced claims

### Authoritativeness
- External citations, backlinks from authoritative sources
- Brand mentions, industry recognition
- Published in recognized outlets
- Cited by other experts

### Trustworthiness
- Contact information, physical address
- Privacy policy, terms of service
- Customer testimonials, reviews
- Date stamps, transparent corrections
- Secure site (HTTPS)

## Content Metrics

### Word Count Analysis
Compare against page type minimums:
| Page Type | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Homepage | 500 |
| Service page | 800 |
| Blog post | 1,500 |
| Product page | 300+ (400+ for complex products) |
| Location page | 500-600 |

> **Important:** These are **topical coverage floors**, not targets. Google has confirmed word count is NOT a direct ranking factor. The goal is comprehensive topical coverage; a 500-word page that thoroughly answers the query will outrank a 2,000-word page that doesn't. Use these as guidelines for adequate coverage depth, not rigid requirements.

### Readability
- Flesch Reading Ease: target 60-70 for general audience

> **Note:** Flesch Reading Ease is a useful proxy for content accessibility but is NOT a direct Google ranking factor. John Mueller has confirmed Google does not use basic readability scores for ranking. Yoast deprioritized Flesch scores in v19.3. Use readability analysis as a content quality indicator, not as an SEO metric to optimize directly.
- Grade level: match target audience
- Sentence length: average 15-20 words
- Paragraph length: 2-4 sentences

### Keyword Optimization
- Primary keyword in title, H1, first 100 words
- Natural density (1-3%)
- Semantic variations present
- No keyword stuffing

### Content Structure
- Logical heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
- Scannable sections with descriptive headings
- Bullet/numbered lists where appropriate
- Table of contents for long-form content

### Multimedia
- Relevant images with proper alt text
- Videos where appropriate
- Infographics for complex data
- Charts/graphs for statistics

### Internal Linking
- 3-5 relevant internal links per 1000 words
- Descriptive anchor text
- Links to related content
- No orphan pages

### External Linking
- Cite authoritative sources
- Open in new tab for user experience
- Reasonable count (not excessive)

## AI Content Assessment (Sept 2025 QRG addition)

Google's raters now formally assess whether content appears AI-generated.

### Acceptable AI Content
- Demonstrates genuine E-E-A-T
- Provides unique value
- Has human oversight and editing
- Contains original insights

### Low-Quality AI Content Markers
- Generic phrasing, lack of specificity
- No original insight
- Repetitive structure across pages
- No author attribution
- Factual inaccuracies

> **Helpful Content System (March 2024):** The Helpful Content System was merged into Google's core ranking algorithm during the March 2024 core update. It no longer operates as a standalone classifier. Helpfulness signals are now weighted within every core update. The same principles apply (people-first content, demonstrating E-E-A-T, satisfying user intent), but enforcement is continuous rather than through separate HCU updates.

## AI Citation Readiness (GEO signals)

Optimize for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews):

- Clear, quotable statements with statistics/facts
- Structured data (especially for data points)
- Strong heading hierarchy (H1->H2->H3 flow)
- Answer-first formatting for key questions
- Tables and lists for comparative data
- Clear attribution and source citations

### AI Search Visibility & GEO (2025-2026)

**Google AI Mode** launched publicly in May 2025 as a separate tab in Google Search, available in 180+ countries. Unlike AI Overviews (which appear above organic results), AI Mode provides a fully conversational search experience with **zero organic blue links**, making AI citation the only visibility mechanism.

**Key optimization strategies for AI citation:**
- **Structured answers:** Clear question-answer formats, definition patterns, and step-by-step instructions that AI systems can extract and cite
- **First-party data:** Original research, statistics, case studies, and unique datasets are highly cited by AI systems
- **Schema markup:** Article, FAQ (for non-Google AI platforms), and structured content schemas help AI systems parse and attribute content
- **Topical authority:** AI systems preferentially cite sources that demonstrate deep expertise. Build content clusters, not isolated pages
- **Entity clarity:** Ensure brand, authors, and key concepts are clearly defined with structured data (Organization, Person schema)
- **Multi-platform tracking:** Monitor visibility across Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot, not just traditional rankings. Treat AI citation as a standalone KPI alongside organic rankings and traffic.

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):**
GEO is the emerging discipline of optimizing content specifically for AI-generated answers. Key GEO signals include: quotability (clear, concise extractable facts), attribution (source citations within your content), structure (well-organized heading hierarchy), and freshness (regularly updated data). Cross-reference the `seo-geo` skill for detailed GEO workflows.

## Content Freshness

### Recommendations

## DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, use `kw_data_google_ads_search_volume` for real keyword volume data, `dataforseo_labs_bulk_keyword_difficulty` for difficulty scores, `dataforseo_labs_search_intent` for intent classification, and `content_analysis_summary` for content quality analysis.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| URL unreachable (DNS failure, connection refused) | Report the error clearly. Do not guess page content. Suggest the user verify the URL and try again. |
| Content behind paywall (402/403, login wall) | Report that the content is not publicly accessible. Analyze only the visible portion (meta tags, headers) and note the limitation. |
| Thin content (fewer than 100 words retrievable) | Report the findings as-is rather than guessing. Flag the page as potentially JavaScript-rendered or gated, and suggest the user provide the full text directly. |

- Link to full pricing page

### Trust Signals
- "Last updated [date]" timestamp
- Author with relevant expertise
- Methodology disclosure (how comparisons were conducted)
- Disclosure of own product affiliation

## Fairness Guidelines

- **Accuracy**: All competitor information must be verifiable from public sources
- **No defamation**: Never make false or misleading claims about competitors
- **Cite sources**: Link to competitor websites, review sites, or documentation
- **Timely updates**: Review and update when competitors release major changes
- **Disclose affiliation**: Clearly state which product is yours
- **Balanced presentation**: Acknowledge competitor strengths honestly
- **Pricing accuracy**: Include "as of [date]" disclaimers on all pricing data
- **Feature verification**: Test competitor features where possible, cite documentation otherwise

## Internal Linking

- Link to your own product/service pages from comparison sections
- Cross-link between related comparison pages (e.g., "A vs B" links to "A vs C")
- Link to feature-specific pages when discussing individual features
- Breadcrumb: Home > Comparisons > [This Page]
- Related comparisons section at bottom of page
- Link to case studies and testimonials mentioned in the comparison

## Output

### Comparison Page Template
- `COMPARISON-PAGE.md`: Ready-to-implement page structure with sections
- Feature matrix table
- Content outline with word count targets (minimum 1,500 words)

### Schema Markup
- `comparison-schema.json`: Product/SoftwareApplication/ItemList JSON-LD

### Keyword Strategy
- Primary and secondary keywords
- Related long-tail opportunities
- Content gaps vs existing competitor pages

### Recommendations
- Content improvements for existing comparison pages
- New comparison page opportunities
- Schema markup additions
- Conversion optimization suggestions

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Competitor URL unreachable | Report which competitor URLs failed. Proceed with available data and note gaps in the comparison. |
| Insufficient competitor data (pricing, features unavailable) | Flag missing data points clearly. Use "Not publicly available" in comparison tables rather than guessing. |
| No product/service overlap found | Report that the products serve different markets. Suggest alternative competitors that share feature overlap, or pivot to a category roundup format. |

# Content Quality & E-E-A-T Analysis

## E-E-A-T Framework (updated Sept 2025 QRG)

Read `resources/references/eeat-framework.md` for full criteria.

### Experience (first-hand signals)
- Original research, case studies, before/after results
- Personal anecdotes, process documentation
- Unique data, proprietary insights
- Photos/videos from direct experience

### Expertise
- Author credentials, certifications, bio
- Professional background relevant to topic
- Technical depth appropriate for audience
- Accurate, well-sourced claims

### Authoritativeness
- External citations, backlinks from authoritative sources
- Brand mentions, industry recognition
- Published in recognized outlets
- Cited by other experts

### Trustworthiness
- Contact information, physical address
- Privacy policy, terms of service
- Customer testimonials, reviews
- Date stamps, transparent corrections
- Secure site (HTTPS)

## Content Metrics

### Word Count Analysis
Compare against page type minimums:
| Page Type | Minimum |
|-----------|---------|
| Homepage | 500 |
| Service page | 800 |
| Blog post | 1,500 |
| Product page | 300+ (400+ for complex products) |
| Location page | 500-600 |

> **Important:** These are **topical coverage floors**, not targets. Google has confirmed word count is NOT a direct ranking factor. The goal is comprehensive topical coverage — a 500-word page that thoroughly answers the query will outrank a 2,000-word page that doesn't. Use these as guidelines for adequate coverage depth, not rigid requirements.

### Readability
- Flesch Reading Ease: target 60-70 for general audience

> **Note:** Flesch Reading Ease is a useful proxy for content accessibility but is NOT a direct Google ranking factor. John Mueller has confirmed Google does not use basic readability scores for ranking. Yoast deprioritized Flesch scores in v19.3. Use readability analysis as a content quality indicator, not as an SEO metric to optimize directly.
- Grade level: match target audience
- Sentence length: average 15-20 words
- Paragraph length: 2-4 sentences

### Keyword Optimization
- Primary keyword in title, H1, first 100 words
- Natural density (1-3%)
- Semantic variations present
- No keyword stuffing

### Content Structure
- Logical heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Scannable sections with descriptive headings
- Bullet/numbered lists where appropriate
- Table of contents for long-form content

### Multimedia
- Relevant images with proper alt text
- Videos where appropriate
- Infographics for complex data
- Charts/graphs for statistics

### Internal Linking
- 3-5 relevant internal links per 1000 words
- Descriptive anchor text
- Links to related content
- No orphan pages

### External Linking
- Cite authoritative sources
- Open in new tab for user experience
- Reasonable count (not excessive)

## AI Content Assessment (Sept 2025 QRG addition)

Google's raters now formally assess whether content appears AI-generated.

### Acceptable AI Content
- Demonstrates genuine E-E-A-T
- Provides unique value
- Has human oversight and editing
- Contains original insights

### Low-Quality AI Content Markers
- Generic phrasing, lack of specificity
- No original insight
- Repetitive structure across pages
- No author attribution
- Factual inaccuracies

> **Helpful Content System (March 2024):** The Helpful Content System was merged into Google's core ranking algorithm during the March 2024 core update. It no longer operates as a standalone classifier. Helpfulness signals are now weighted within every core update — the same principles apply (people-first content, demonstrating E-E-A-T, satisfying user intent), but enforcement is continuous rather than through separate HCU updates.

## AI Citation Readiness (GEO signals)

Optimize for AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews):

- Clear, quotable statements with statistics/facts
- Structured data (especially for data points)
- Strong heading hierarchy (H1→H2→H3 flow)
- Answer-first formatting for key questions
- Tables and lists for comparative data
- Clear attribution and source citations

### AI Search Visibility & GEO (2025-2026)

**Google AI Mode** launched publicly in May 2025 as a separate tab in Google Search, available in 180+ countries. Unlike AI Overviews (which appear above organic results), AI Mode provides a fully conversational search experience with **zero organic blue links** — making AI citation the only visibility mechanism.

**Key optimization strategies for AI citation:**
- **Structured answers:** Clear question-answer formats, definition patterns, and step-by-step instructions that AI systems can extract and cite
- **First-party data:** Original research, statistics, case studies, and unique datasets are highly cited by AI systems
- **Schema markup:** Article, FAQ (for non-Google AI platforms), and structured content schemas help AI systems parse and attribute content
- **Topical authority:** AI systems preferentially cite sources that demonstrate deep expertise — build content clusters, not isolated pages
- **Entity clarity:** Ensure brand, authors, and key concepts are clearly defined with structured data (Organization, Person schema)
- **Multi-platform tracking:** Monitor visibility across Google AI Overviews, AI Mode, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot — not just traditional rankings. Treat AI citation as a standalone KPI alongside organic rankings and traffic.

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO):**
GEO is the emerging discipline of optimizing content specifically for AI-generated answers. Key GEO signals include: quotability (clear, concise extractable facts), attribution (source citations within your content), structure (well-organized heading hierarchy), and freshness (regularly updated data). Cross-reference the `seo-geo` skill for detailed GEO workflows.

## Passage Indexing Optimization

Google's Passage Indexing (active since 2021) ranks individual passages independently for specific long-tail queries. Optimize by:

- Ensuring each major section (H2 or H3 block) is self-contained and answers one clear question
- Keeping optimal passage length at 100-200 words per block
- Using descriptive headings that provide context even if the passage is extracted
- Front-loading the direct answer in the first 40-50 words of the passage

## Content Freshness

- Publication date visible
- Last updated date if content has been revised
- Flag content older than 12 months without update for fast-changing topics

## Output

### Content Quality Score: XX/100

### E-E-A-T Breakdown
| Factor | Score | Key Signals |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Experience | XX/25 | ... |
| Expertise | XX/25 | ... |
| Authoritativeness | XX/25 | ... |
| Trustworthiness | XX/25 | ... |

  templates, competitive analysis, content strategy, and implementation
  roadmap. Use when user says "SEO plan", "SEO strategy", "content strategy",

---

# Strategic SEO Planning

## Process

### 1. Discovery
- Business type, target audience, competitors, goals
- Current site assessment (if exists)
- Budget and timeline constraints
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

### 2. Competitive Analysis
- Identify top 5 competitors
- Analyze their content strategy, schema usage, technical setup
- Identify keyword gaps and content opportunities
- Assess their E-E-A-T signals
- Estimate their domain authority

### 3. Architecture Design
- Load industry template from `resources/templates/`
- Design URL hierarchy and content pillars
- Plan internal linking strategy
- Sitemap structure with quality gates applied
- Information architecture for user journeys

### 4. Content Strategy
- Content gaps vs competitors — use `scripts/competitor_gap.py` for data-driven analysis
- Page types and estimated counts
- Blog/resource topics and publishing cadence
- E-E-A-T building plan (author bios, credentials, experience signals)
- Content calendar with priorities

### 4.5 Topical Authority Cluster Planning

**Why:** Google's Helpful Content system rewards sites demonstrating comprehensive topical expertise. A single page on "red team ops" ranks worse than a hub of 8-15 interlinked articles covering the topic from multiple angles.

#### Hub-and-Spoke Model

```
                    [Pillar Page]
                   /      |       \
          [Cluster 1] [Cluster 2] [Cluster 3]
          /    \        |    \        |    \
       [Sub] [Sub]   [Sub] [Sub]  [Sub] [Sub]
```

#### Pillar Page Requirements
- **Word count**: 3,000-5,000 words (comprehensive overview)
- **Structure**: Covers all major subtopics at surface level, links to each cluster article for depth
- **Target keyword**: Head term (e.g., "cobalt strike beacon")
- **Internal links**: Bidirectional links to/from every cluster article
- **Schema**: Add `Article` or `WebPage` schema with `about` and `mentions` properties

#### Cluster Article Requirements
- **Word count**: 1,500-3,000 words (deep dive on one aspect)
- **Target keyword**: Long-tail variant (e.g., "cobalt strike beacon sleep mask")
- **Internal links**: Must link back to pillar page + 2-3 sibling cluster articles
- **Freshness**: Update cluster articles when new information becomes available

#### Planning Process
1. **Identify 3-5 pillar topics** from your core competencies or target keywords
2. **Generate 8-15 cluster topics** per pillar using:
   - Google Autocomplete / People Also Ask
   - `scripts/competitor_gap.py` for competitor-covered subtopics
   - `scripts/article_seo.py --json` for related keyword extraction
3. **Map content to URLs** following flat architecture: `/pillar/cluster-article`
4. **Set internal link rules**: every cluster → pillar (required), cluster ↔ cluster (2-3 siblings)
5. **Track coverage**: maintain a topic-cluster spreadsheet with status and publish dates

#### Industry Cluster Templates

| Industry | Example Pillar | Cluster Topics (sample) |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Cybersecurity | Penetration Testing | OSINT, Web App Testing, Network Pentesting, Reporting, Tools, Methodology, Compliance |
| SaaS | Product Documentation | Getting Started, API Reference, Integrations, Troubleshooting, Best Practices, Migration |
| E-commerce | Product Category | Buying Guide, Comparison, Care Guide, Reviews, FAQ, Accessories |
| Local Service | Service Area | City-specific pages, Service FAQ, Pricing, Before/After, Testimonials |

### 5. Technical Foundation
- Hosting and performance requirements
- Schema markup plan per page type
- Core Web Vitals baseline targets
- AI search readiness requirements
- Mobile-first considerations

### 6. Implementation Roadmap (4 phases)

#### Phase 1 — Foundation (weeks 1-4)
- Technical setup and infrastructure
- Core pages (home, about, contact, main services)
- Essential schema implementation
- Analytics and tracking setup

#### Phase 2 — Expansion (weeks 5-12)
- Content creation for primary pages
- Blog launch with initial posts
- Internal linking structure
- Local SEO setup (if applicable)

#### Phase 3 — Scale (weeks 13-24)
- Advanced content development

# SEO Sub-Skill: Article Analysis

**Trigger**: `seo article <url>`

This sub-skill focuses on deep keyword research and content analysis for a specific article or blog post, leveraging LLM intelligence for natural language optimization rather than rigid rules.

Apply `resources/references/llm-audit-rubric.md` for evidence standards, confidence labels, severity mapping, and report structure.

## Process

### 1. Data Extraction
Run the article extraction script to fetch the page, parse the content structure (title, meta, headings, paragraphs, images), and perform initial keyword extraction (TF-IDF) alongside LSI keyword discovery (via Google Autocomplete).

```bash
python3 <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/article_seo.py <url> --keyword "<optional_target_keyword>" --json
```

### 2. LLM-Driven Analysis
Feed the JSON output from the extractor into your context.

Act as an expert SEO Editor and analyze the extracted data to provide:
1. **Title Tag & Meta Description Optimization**: Suggest high-CTR, keyword-optimized replacements if the current ones are missing or suboptimal.
2. **Context-Aware Content Enrichment**: Identify specific paragraphs where LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords can be injected naturally to build topical depth—always avoiding keyword stuffing. Provide the exact "Current Paragraph" and the "Suggested Replacement".
3. **Image SEO**: Suggest descriptive, keyword-aware alt text for any images missing the `alt` attribute.

### 3. Reporting
Format your generated SEO recommendations clearly using Markdown, ensuring the user receives actionable, copy-pasteable "before and after" examples.

  Answer Engine Optimization audit — optimizes for zero-click rich results:
  Featured Snippets, People Also Ask (PAA), Knowledge Panel, and Sitelinks
  Searchbox. Distinct from GEO (AI-generated summaries). Use when user says
  "featured snippet", "people also ask", "knowledge panel", "answer box",
  "zero-click", or "AEO".
---

# Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

AEO targets **zero-click rich results** in both traditional search and AI-powered search interfaces. Unlike GEO (AI Overview / Perplexity passage citation), AEO targets specific SERP features that display answers directly on the results page.

## AEO vs GEO

| Target | Signal Selection | Optimization Focus |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Featured Snippet** (AEO) | Best direct answer to exact query | 40-55 word answer immediately after matching H-tag |
| **People Also Ask** (AEO) | Question-intent pages, conversational H-tags | Question-phrased H2/H3, concise 30-50 word answer |
| **Knowledge Panel** (AEO) | Entity KG match (Wikipedia/Wikidata) | `sameAs`, Organization/Person schema, entity disambiguation |
| **Sitelinks Searchbox** (AEO) | Site authority + WebSite schema | `WebSite` + `SearchAction` schema |
| **AI Overview** (GEO) | Passage-level citability, brand authority | `llms.txt`, structured data, citation-ready prose |

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Featured Snippet Optimization

**Detection:**
- Check if the target URL currently owns any Featured Snippets (requires GSC or manual SERP check)
- Identify the primary keyword intent: informational (paragraph), list, or table snippet

**Optimization requirements:**

#### Paragraph Snippet (most common for informational queries)
- [ ] Direct answer in the **first 40-55 words** of the first paragraph after a relevant H2 or H3
- [ ] Answer starts with the keyword or a variant: "X is...", "X refers to...", "To do X..."
- [ ] No jargon in the first answer sentence — plain language
- [ ] Supporting context paragraph follows (2-4 sentences)

#### List Snippet (procedures, rankings, comparisons)
- [ ] Use `<ol>` (ordered) or `<ul>` (unordered) immediately after the H2/H3 question
- [ ] 5-9 list items — more than 9 triggers "more items" truncation
- [ ] Each item ≤ 12 words for clean display
- [ ] H2/H3 must be phrased as the actual question users search

#### Table Snippet (comparisons, pricing, specifications)
- [ ] Use `<table>` with `<th>` header row
- [ ] ≤4 columns (wider tables are truncated)
- [ ] First column is the primary entity (product, plan, country)

**`speakable` schema (voice + Google Assistant):**
```json
{
  "@type": "Article",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [".article-summary", "[itemprop='description']"]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. People Also Ask (PAA) Optimization

PAA questions are selected by Google based on semantic relatedness to the primary query. Owning multiple PAA entries significantly increases SERP real estate.

**Optimization requirements:**
- [ ] Identify the top 5-8 PAA questions for your primary keyword (check SERPs manually or via ahrefs/SemRush)
- [ ] Each PAA question should have its own H2 or H3 phrased **exactly as the question** users ask
- [ ] Directly below each question H-tag: a 30-50 word direct answer paragraph
- [ ] Avoid filler phrases ("Great question!", "In this article we will...") — Google penalizes these for PAA
- [ ] Add `FAQPage` schema **only if your site qualifies** (restricted to government/healthcare authority sites post-2023); for others, use `Article` with `speakable`

**Example HTML structure for PAA:**
```html
<h2>What is Qwen3-TTS voice cloning?</h2>
<p>Qwen3-TTS is an open-source text-to-speech model from Alibaba that enables
offline voice cloning from a 3-10 second audio sample. It runs entirely locally,
requiring no cloud API, making it suitable for OpSec-sensitive environments.</p>
```

---

### 3. Knowledge Panel Signals

Knowledge Panels are sourced from Google's Knowledge Graph. They appear for entities (people, organizations, products/brands).

**Entity presence checklist:**
- [ ] **Wikipedia article** exists for the entity (person, company, product) — highest signal
- [ ] **Wikidata QID** assigned — use `entity_checker.py` to check
- [ ] **`sameAs` properties** in Organization/Person schema point to Wikipedia, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Crunchbase:
  ```json
  {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Example Corp",
    "sameAs": [
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Example_Corp",
      "https://www.linkedin.com/company/example-corp",
      "https://twitter.com/examplecorp"
    ]
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Google Business Profile** claimed and consistent name/address/phone (NAP)
- [ ] **Social profiles** publicly linked from the website
- [ ] **Logo** via `Organization` schema with `logo` property pointing to a stable URL

**Common mistakes:**
- Inconsistent entity name across platforms (e.g., "Example Corp" vs "Example Corporation")
- No Wikipedia article → no Knowledge Panel (organic mentions in 3rd-party authoritative sources help)
- `sameAs` pointing to broken or redirected URLs

---

### 4. Sitelinks Searchbox

Appears when users search your brand directly. Requires:
- High brand search volume (signal: GSC showing branded queries)
- `WebSite` schema with `SearchAction` pointing to your internal search URL

**Required schema:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": {
      "@type": "EntryPoint",
      "urlTemplate": "https://example.com/search?q={search_term_string}"
    },
    "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
  }
}
```

- [ ] Schema added to **homepage only**
- [ ] `urlTemplate` returns a valid results page (not 404)
- [ ] Internal site search is functional and indexes your content

competitive intent keywords with accurate, structured content.

## Page Types

### 1. "X vs Y" Comparison Pages
- Direct head-to-head comparison between two products/services
- Balanced feature-by-feature analysis
- Clear verdict or recommendation with justification
- Target keyword: `[Product A] vs [Product B]`

### 2. "Alternatives to X" Pages
- List of alternatives to a specific product/service

## Comparison Table Generation

### Feature Matrix Layout
```
| Feature          | Your Product | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|------------------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Feature 1        | ✅           | ✅           | ❌           |
| Feature 2        | ✅           | ⚠️ Partial   | ✅           |
| Feature 3        | ✅           | ❌           | ❌           |
| Pricing (from)   | $X/mo        | $Y/mo        | $Z/mo        |
| Free Tier        | ✅           | ❌           | ✅           |
```

### Data Accuracy Requirements
- All feature claims must be verifiable from public sources
- Pricing must be current (include "as of [date]" note)
- Update frequency: review quarterly or when competitors ship major changes
- Link to source for each competitor data point where possible

## Schema Markup Recommendations

### Product Schema with AggregateRating
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "[Product Name]",
  "description": "[Product Description]",
  "brand": {
    "@type": "Brand",
    "name": "[Brand Name]"
  },
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "[Rating]",
    "reviewCount": "[Count]",
    "bestRating": "5",
    "worstRating": "1"
  }
}
```

### SoftwareApplication (for software comparisons)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "[Software Name]",
  "applicationCategory": "[Category]",
  "operatingSystem": "[OS]",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "[Price]",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
```

### ItemList (for roundup pages)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Best [Category] Tools [Year]",
  "itemListOrder": "https://schema.org/ItemListOrderDescending",
  "numberOfItems": "[Count]",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "[Product Name]",
      "url": "[Product URL]"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Keyword Targeting

### Comparison Intent Patterns
| Pattern | Example | Search Volume Signal |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| `[A] vs [B]` | "Slack vs Teams" | High |
| `[A] alternative` | "Figma alternatives" | High |
| `[A] alternatives [year]` | "Notion alternatives 2026" | High |
| `best [category] tools` | "best project management tools" | High |
| `[A] vs [B] for [use case]` | "AWS vs Azure for startups" | Medium |
| `[A] review [year]` | "Monday.com review 2026" | Medium |
| `[A] vs [B] pricing` | "HubSpot vs Salesforce pricing" | Medium |
| `is [A] better than [B]` | "is Notion better than Confluence" | Medium |

### Title Tag Formulas
- X vs Y: `[A] vs [B]: [Key Differentiator] ([Year])`
- Alternatives: `[N] Best [A] Alternatives in [Year] (Free & Paid)`
- Roundup: `[N] Best [Category] Tools in [Year], Compared & Ranked`

### H1 Patterns
- Match title tag intent
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Keep under 70 characters

## Conversion-Optimized Layouts

### CTA Placement
- **Above fold**: Brief comparison summary with primary CTA
- **After comparison table**: "Try [Your Product] free" CTA
- **Bottom of page**: Final recommendation with CTA
- Avoid aggressive CTAs in competitor description sections (reduces trust)

### Social Proof Sections
- Customer testimonials relevant to comparison criteria
- G2/Capterra/TrustPilot ratings (with source links)
- Case studies showing migration from competitor
- "Switched from [Competitor]" stories

### Pricing Highlights
- Clear pricing comparison table
- Highlight value advantages (not just lowest price)
- Include hidden costs (setup fees, per-user pricing, overage charges)
- Link to full pricing page

### Trust Signals
- "Last updated [date]" timestamp
- Author with relevant expertise
- Methodology disclosure (how comparisons were conducted)
- Disclosure of own product affiliation

## Fairness Guidelines

- **Accuracy**: All competitor information must be verifiable from public sources
- **No defamation**: Never make false or misleading claims about competitors
- **Cite sources**: Link to competitor websites, review sites, or documentation
- **Timely updates**: Review and update when competitors release major changes
- **Disclose affiliation**: Clearly state which product is yours
- **Balanced presentation**: Acknowledge competitor strengths honestly
- **Pricing accuracy**: Include "as of [date]" disclaimers on all pricing data
- **Feature verification**: Test competitor features where possible, cite documentation otherwise

## Internal Linking

- Link to your own product/service pages from comparison sections
- Cross-link between related comparison pages (e.g., "A vs B" links to "A vs C")
- Link to feature-specific pages when discussing individual features
- Breadcrumb: Home > Comparisons > [This Page]
- Related comparisons section at bottom of page
- Link to case studies and testimonials mentioned in the comparison

## Output

### Comparison Page Template
- `COMPARISON-PAGE.md`: Ready-to-implement page structure with sections
- Feature matrix table
- Content outline with word count targets (minimum 1,500 words)

### Schema Markup
- `comparison-schema.json`: Product/SoftwareApplication/ItemList JSON-LD

### Keyword Strategy
- Primary and secondary keywords
- Related long-tail opportunities
- Content gaps vs existing competitor pages

### Recommendations
- Content improvements for existing comparison pages
- New comparison page opportunities
- Schema markup additions
- Conversion optimization suggestions

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Competitor URL unreachable | Report which competitor URLs failed. Proceed with available data and note gaps in the comparison. |
| Insufficient competitor data (pricing, features unavailable) | Flag missing data points clearly. Use "Not publicly available" in comparison tables rather than guessing. |
| No product/service overlap found | Report that the products serve different markets. Suggest alternative competitors that share feature overlap, or pivot to a category roundup format. |
